# Welcome to the CasperLabs wiki!

This document provides information about how you can get going with the CasperLabs Community Engagement Program.  

So far the development has been through internal resources and we are now at a stage of actively engaging with the Casperlabs Community Members (CCM) also known as CLarity Member (CM); adding features, improving functionality, developing dApps, fixing security holes and bugs, and contributing your insights and feedback to advance the evolution of our CasperLabs project.	

## Current Developments
CasperLabs has developed a fully decentralized, sharded and scalable next-generation blockchain, implementing Correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper proof-of-stake protocol.

** Devnet (Public Dev Net) ** 
We recently launched Devnet, our Public Dev Net where Developers can run nodes and connect to a public bootstrap node.
 
** Testnet (Public Test Net) ** 
We are also well on schedule for November 2019 to launch Testnet;  the feature complete, decentralized Public Test Net.

Note: CasperLabs does not yet have a bounty program but may consider one after launch of Testnet.

## Future Developments
Main Net Launch in 2020


# Participating in the CasperLabs Community

The information provided herein is intended for CasperLabs Community members as follows:

* Validators / Node Operators (Investors) are members of our community who validate transactions on our platform

* dApp Developers (Developers) are members of our Community who build Apps using our CasperLabs features. You can install our environment locally, create and test Smart contracts with our Smart Contracts and Test Libraries and use these libraries to build your own applications,

* Freelance Developers are members of our CasperLabs Community who are developers and engineers interested in contributing to our CasperLabs core capabilities,

* General Blockchain Enthusiasts members of the CasperLabs Community who support this technology and are interested in learning more about CasperLabs progress on our roadmap,
 
# Getting Started
The open-source CasperLabs project is building a decentralized, economic, censorship-resistant, public computer infrastructure and blockchain. It hosts and execute programs popularly referred to as “smart contracts”. It is trustworthy, scalable, concurrent, with proof-of-stake consensus and content delivery. See our Technical Specification https://techspec.casperlabs.io/  (in process) to understand why. 
 
## Validators/Node Operators (Investors)
With this documentation you will gain insight and understanding about what CasperLabs is building
Learn how to operate a validator node or stake the network and understand economics behind it
Join a community of like-minded believers

**Pre-requisites:**
* Web access
* Basic understanding on how to use web applications for generating and validating blockchain transactions.
* Download and Set Up a Node

See what is currently available in CasperLabs most current versions and get started with CasperLabs Explorer application. 
https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/releases

The CasperLabs Explorer takes one to the GUI to setup keys, obtain muneration, run transactions https://explorer.casperlabs.io/

## dApp Developers
Developers (Developer Journey)  want to:

* Understand what CasperLabs is building
  * Architecture
    https://casperlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/12713999/Architecture+of+the+CasperLabs+node
* How to build and operate applications on the platform
* How to set up the CasperLabs environment locally
* How to create and test Smart Contracts with our Libraries

**Pre-requisites:**
Linux (OSx coming in October)
Programming knowledge
