# Welcome to the CasperLabs wiki!

This document provides information about how you can participate with our CasperLabs Community Engagement Program.

So far the development of CasperLabs solution has been progressing with our internal resources and we are now at a stage of actively engaging our CasperLabs Community Members (CCM), also known as the CLarity Member (CM): adding features, improving functionality, developing dApps, fixing security holes and bugs, and contributing insights and feedback to advance the evolution of CasperLabs platform.

## Current Developments

CasperLabs has developed a fully decentralized, sharded, and scalable next-generation blockchain solution, implementing the Correct-by-construction  Casper (CBC-Casper ) proof-of-stake protocol. This public computer infrastructure and blockchain is especially designed for hosting and executing programs referred to as “smart contracts”, to ensure a trustworthy, scalable, concurrent, proof-of-stake consensus and content delivery model. 

### Devnet (Public Dev Net)

We recently launched Devnet, our Public Dev Net where Developers can run nodes and connect to a public bootstrap node.

### Testnet (Public Test Net)

We are also well on schedule for November 2019 to launch Testnet; the feature complete, decentralized Public Test Net.

Note: CasperLabs does not as of yet have a bounty program but may consider one after the Testnet launch.

## Roadmap

Main Net Launch in 2020


# Participating in the CasperLabs Community

Powered by the first implementation of Vlad Zamfir’s CBC-Casper proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, a standard that is most efficient for blockchain optimizing resources to maximize processing power toward actual transactions, CasperLabs removes barriers that prevent mainstream blockchain adoption by being completely open source, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and highly secure. 

_See our_ [Technical Specification]( https://techspec.casperlabs.io/) to understand how, and get started with the information herein provided for CasperLabs Community members as follows:

- **Validators / Node Operators** (Investors) are members of our Community who validate transactions on our platform

- **dApp Developers** (Developers) are members of our Community who build Apps using our CasperLabs features. You can install our environment locally, create and test Smart contracts with our Smart Contracts and Test Libraries, and use these libraries to build your own applications,

- **Freelance Developer Community** are members of our CasperLabs Community who are developers and engineers interested in contributing to our CasperLabs core development,

- **General Blockchain Enthusiasts** are members of the CasperLabs Community who support blockchain technology and are interested in learning more about CasperLabs progress and impact on the world of blockchain technology,
