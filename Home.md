# Welcome to the CasperLabs wiki!

This document provides information about how you can participate with our CasperLabs Community Engagement Program.
So far the development has been progressing with our internal resources and we are now at a stage of actively engaging our CasperLabs Community Members (CCM), also known as a CLarity Member (CM): adding features, improving functionality, developing dApps, fixing security holes and bugs, and contributing insights and feedback to advance the evolution of CasperLabs open source blockchain solution.

## Current Developments

CasperLabs has developed a fully decentralized, sharded and scalable next-generation blockchain, implementing Correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper proof-of-stake protocol.

The CasperLabs project is a decentralized, economic, censorship-resistant, public computer infrastructure and blockchain especially designed for hosting and executing programs popularly referred to as “smart contracts” ensuring a trustworthy, scalable, concurrent, proof-of-stake consensus and content delivery model. 

### Devnet (Public Dev Net)

We recently launched Devnet, our Public Dev Net where Developers can run nodes and connect to a public bootstrap node.

### Testnet (Public Test Net)

We are also well on schedule for November 2019 to launch Testnet; the feature complete, decentralized Public Test Net.

Note: CasperLabs does not as of yet have a bounty program but may consider one after launch of Testnet.

## Roadmap

Main Net Launch in 2020


# Participating in the CasperLabs Community

Powered by the first implementation of Vlad Zamfir’s CBC Casper proof-of-stake protocol, more efficient by optimizing resources to put more processing power toward actual transactions. CasperLabs removes barriers that prevent mainstream blockchain adoption being open source with while ensuring completely decentralized with highest security. 

_See our_ [Technical Specification]( https://techspec.casperlabs.io/) to understand how, and get started with our resources herein with information provided for CasperLabs Community members as follows:

- **Validators / Node Operators** (Investors) are members of our Community who validate transactions on our platform

- **dApp Developers** (Developers) are members of our Community who build Apps using our CasperLabs features. You can install our environment locally, create and test Smart contracts with our Smart Contracts and Test Libraries and use these libraries to build your own applications,

- **Freelance Developer Community** are members of our CasperLabs Community who are developers and engineers interested in contributing to our CasperLabs core capabilities,

- **General Blockchain Enthusiasts** are members of the CasperLabs Community who support blockchain technology and are interested in learning more about CasperLabs progress and impact on the world of blockchain technology,
