# About this challenge
**State Queries with GraphQL**:  Write and execute a Smart contract on our platform. Read data from the network and use our GraphQL APIs in a new, surprising way. Build a project from the ground up using an existing open source project, or leverage a cloud service you are familiar with.

## Get Started
During the hackathon, you will use CasperLabs node's GraphQL interface. 
* **Access** our GraphQL APIs and schema through the console on our [Clarity self-service portal](https://clarity.casperlabs.io/#/). If you are not familiar with GraphQL, their website is [**here**](https://graphql.org).
 
## Connect with Us Real Time
